# Usage

## Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with automatic transpilation and server restart:

## Production Mode

To build the project for production:

```bash
  npm run build
```

This command uses the TypeScript compiler `tsc` to transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript. The compiled code is output to the `dist` directory.

To start the application in production mode:

```bash
  npm start
```

## Code Linting
